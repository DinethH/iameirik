        <p>Norsk Tipping is the national lottery in Norway. The company is assigned by the government to offer attractive games, give profit to good causes and provide a safe and protective environment for responsible gaming. For me it is about dreams, sports and excitement.</p>

Norsk tipping were failing basic expectations on the digital channels.</p>

      <h2>Making a smooth and frictionless user experience</h2>
       <p>In order to make a smooth and frictionless user experience that built upon the excitement, dream and entertainment, we first had to get to know them better. We started building a deep understanding of our users.</p>
       <ul>
          <li>We used user journey mapping as a method to discover pain points, hightint-lights and opportunities in the users journey</li>
          <li>We built a close connection with the customer service</li>
          <li>We addressed the pain points and solved them one by one</li>
          <li>Established regular user testing of new releases</li>
          <li>We started tracking user behaviour with tools like Google Analytics</li>

        <p>We approach the problem of inconsistency by creating a strict AND flexible system. Yes, both at the same time. Strict in the way that elements.</p>
        <p>Design of a system with reusable patterns and components balancing a cohesive and unified experience across ALL games, still giving space for each games characteristics and brand. Made possible with a common code library/styleguide.</p>
        <p>Modular design is about breaking down a design into small parts (modules), creating them independently, and then later combining them into a larger system.</p>
        <p>A design system’s purpose is to provide consistent, tested and reusable solutions for a common UX problem.
  It means that it takes less time to build new features and pages. Whilst the initial period of designing and developing a pattern library may take a while, the benefits that follow will save time and improve the code base.</p>

        <q>“Norsk Tipping is at the forefront of this year’s competition with a well crafted, easy-to-use, user-friendly and visually appealing website. Like the Vinmonopolet, the company performs a demanding balance between tempting and warning, and the jury thinks Norway-tipping.no helps solve this social mission in a very good way, although it is naturally “tempted” more than “warned”.
        The jury congratulates Norsk Tipping with a well deserved victory and GOLD in Open Class, Farmand Award Best Website 2014!”</q>
